## Current Features

- Premade classic physics entities (normal and acceleration lines, rider and sled skeletons, and the rider-skeleton mount)
- Builders for custom line types, skeleton types, and mount types
- Timeline seeking (with iteration and subiteration views available)
- Timeline-based functions to modify physics parameter (such as gravity)
- Test fixtures borrowed from [lr-core-py](https://github.com/Malizma333/lr-core-py) to ensure compatibility with existing engines
