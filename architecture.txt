Notes:

Should one instance of Engine be created during the entire program?
- No, new engine will be created when loading a track or creating a new track, but will be modified otherwise

Who should be responsible for storing mutable line data and passing it around when it updates?
- physics lines should be owned by and accessed by the engine, with update methods
- abstract "line" entities are handled by the application(?)
  - maybe create a new library interface that works with the canvas overall?

Where should physics types belong for reusability in other crates?
- respective physics crates, with duplicate types in format for serialization only

Where should builder structs go? Should builders be combined with the entities themselves (getters/setters?)
- replace builders with getter/setters

How should line triggers interact with frame triggers?
- 

When should there be defaults?
- Defaults should be provided by the track being deserialized, unless they are necessary (?)

How can layers be a cleaner type?
- Enum first, then struct
